# School_District_Analysis
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook with Python

## Overview of the school district analysis:
The school board has contacted Maria to help with some analysis on the school and student data so they could make plans for their upcoming academic year. Maria seeked our help to complete the school district analysis where we combined two datasets, cleaned the data and did a bunch of calculations such as;
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- Average % Passing Math
- Average % Passing Reading
- Average % Overall Passing

After our initial analysis, the school board notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. 

We are here to help Maria replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once we replaced the math and reading scores, we repeated the school district analysis to see how these changes affected the overall analysis.
